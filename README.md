# Loading-Animation
## A beautiful loading animation using only HTML5 &amp; CSS3

HOLA! This is Zunayed. In this repository, I've put all the files required to produce an animated loading icon on your web. To do so, I used only a HTML file and a CSS file. The HTML file holds the property to show the web page as a whole and the most importantly CSS file holds the entire blueprint of the animation. The MOV file contains a video of how the animation should look according to my codes.

Feel free to download and edit the codes using any text editor. Suggest me to make better contents and please give me interesting tips for my improvement. CHEERS!

Sincerely,
